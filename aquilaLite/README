About the libraries
-------------------

These libraries are lightweight versions of modules
from the Aquila cognitive robotics framework:

http://aquila.sourceforge.net/


They have been created to enable use of the functionality 
in iCub C++ programs without the overhead of installing
the full Aquila.

Tracker  (libtracker)
---------------------

Allows easy extraction of objects from the scene by using
a saturation view. Bounding boxes are calculated for each
distinct object and are streamed to a data port. Tracker can
also locate motion in the scene.

iCubMotor (libcubmotor)
-----------------------

Provides a few useful utilities for iCub movements.

moveHead(x,y) moves the icub head to look at a position in
image coordinates (x,y)

point()  allows iCub to point where the head is looking 
(this functionality is still under construction as it requires
a cartesian controller to be running)


To build the aquila libraries
-----------------------------

1. cd to build directory

2. do ccmake ../

3. do sudo make install to install libtracker and libcubmotor to /usr/local/lib

4. manually copy the include files to /usr/local/include
